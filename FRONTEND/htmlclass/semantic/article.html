        <article>We introduce ourselves because it is the first step to starting any communication. An introduction helps others know who we are, gives them context about why we are present in that situation, and creates a base for building connections. It also leaves a first impression, which often shapes how people see us later. By sharing our name, background, or a little about our interests, we make it easier for others to relate to us and continue the conversation. In simple words, introducing ourselves is like opening the door to interaction and making others comfortable to engage with us.</article>
